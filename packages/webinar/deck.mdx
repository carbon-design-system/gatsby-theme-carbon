# Carbon's website backstory

- Started as a standard React project
- Rebuilt using Gatsby and MDX
- Other teams wanted in

<Notes>

- Difficult for content authors and designers to contribute
- Big win for empowering non-technical contributors
- Only option was to fork Carbon
  - No way to get new features or fixes.
  - Developers innundated with config they don't own or understand

</Notes>

---

# Enter Gatsby themes

- Development speed
- Visual solidarity
- Shared features and fixes between teams
- Managed dependancies and configuration

<Notes>

- Broke ground April 15th,
  - 2 teams with no Gatsby or react experience
  - Both hit June 1st deadline
  - If you can write markdown, you can build a site with Carbon we fill in the blanks around your content
- unity through UI
- Encouraged community envolvement
  - in core theme components (edit in Github)
  - in MDX components (Accordion)
- Easily move between projects, only manage the config you want (progressive disclosure)

# Aha! moments with Gatsby themes

1. Oh wow. really just had to write markdown tho
1. Can't be blocked by theme
1. Immense power of shadowing

---

# Shadowing revelations

<img style={{ width: '60vw' }} src={Wow} />

<span style={{fontWeight: 300, fontSize: '0.6em', color: 'darkgrey', position: 'absolute', bottom: '-0.5em'}}>

**note:** the Carbon designers did not approve this slide

</span>

<Notes>

Need to do at least the first one

# Shadow to provide props

```jsx
import Header from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/components/Header';

const CustomHeader = props => (
  <Header {...props}>
    <span>Gatsby theme </span>Carbon
  </Header>
);

export default CustomHeader;
```

---

# Shadow whole components

```jsx
import { styles } from '@carbon/type';

const CustomHeader = styled.span({
  ...styles.expressiveHeading04,
});

export default props => {
  console.log(props);
  return <CustomHeader>Gatsby Theme Carbon</CustomHeader>;
};
```

---

# Shadow _everything_

- Sass ‚Äì `src/components/Markdown.module.scss`
- Data ‚Äì `src/components/Code/prismTheme.js`
- Hooks - `src/util/hooks/useSearch.js`

---

# Shadowing guidelines

1. Communication
1. Less is more
1. Communication

<Notes>

- to make sure no one is working on your change already
- Shadow as few files as you can to achieve your goal
- If you do shadow, tell the theme developer, used to inform future development

<Notes>

- content authors and designers contribute like never before
