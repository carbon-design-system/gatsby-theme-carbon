# Carbon's website backstory

<Backstory />

<Notes>

## - Difficult for content authors and designers to contribute

## - Big win for empowering non-technical contributors

## - Only option was to fork Carbon

---

### Pitfalls

## - No way to get new features or fixes.

## - Developers stuck with config they don't own/understand

</Notes>

---

# Other teams at IBM wanted in

- Process was to fork and copy the Carbon website
- Needed to understand configuration settings
- No design updates
- No bug fixes

---

# Enter Gatsby themes

---

# Big wins with Gatsby themes

- Development speed
- Visual solidarity
- Shared features and fixes
- Theme-managed configuration

<Notes>

- speed
  - Broke ground April 15th,
  - 2 teams with June 1st deadline (45 days)
  - both teams with 0 no react and no gatsby experience
  - 3. Both hit June 1st deadline
- unity through core UI components and global MDX
- community envolvement grew due to shared tooling
  - in core theme components (edit in Github)
  - in MDX content components
- only manage the dependancies & config you want (progressive disclosure)

## transition: big win for devs, shadowing another new big win

## Revelations while building with themes

1. Oh wow. Actually just writing fancy markdown tho
1. Can't be blocked by theme
1. Immense power of shadowing

<Notes>

# In order

## - 2. big selling point for teams considering

</Notes>

# What is shadowing?

<ul>
<li>Allows developers to augment or replace files in a theme</li>

<Appear>

<li>Shadowed files go in directory named after the theme
<ul>
<li className="list-p">

ex. `src/gatsby-theme-carbon/components/Footer.js`

</li>
<li>anything in this folder replaces the theme's version</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

The theme will reach for _your_ component first

</li>
<li>Shadowed components receive same props</li>

</Appear>

</ul>

<Notes>

# Content heavy slide

</Notes>

# Shadowing revelations

<img style={{ width: '60vw' }} src={Wow} />

<span style={{fontWeight: 300, fontSize: '0.6em', color: 'darkgrey', position: 'absolute', bottom: '-0.5em'}}>

**note:** the Carbon designers did not approve this slide

</span>

<Notes>

# At least the first one to get rid of filler content

</Notes>

---

# Shadow to provide props

```jsx
import Header from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/components/Header';

const CustomHeader = props => (
  <Header {...props}>
    <span>Gatsby theme </span>Carbon
  </Header>
);

export default CustomHeader;
```

<Notes>

# Don't forget to spread props

</Notes>

---

# Shadow whole components

```jsx
import { styles } from '@carbon/type';

const CustomHeader = styled.span({
  ...styles.expressiveHeading04,
});

export default props => {
  console.log(props);
  return <CustomHeader>Gatsby Theme Carbon</CustomHeader>;
};
```

<Notes>

# Here we're creating our own novel component

# no need to import

# Log to view props

</Notes>

---

# Shadow _everything_

- Sass ‚Äì `src/components/Markdown.module.scss`
- Data ‚Äì `src/components/Code/prismTheme.js`
- Hooks - `src/util/hooks/useSearch.js`

<Notes>

## - Hooks are a new react API that allow you to encapsulate logic/behavior

## - shadowing hook to provide 3rd party search

## - reveals search component

</Notes>

# Shadowing guidelines

1. Communication
1. Less is more
1. Communication

<Notes>

## - to make sure no one is working on your change already

## - Shadow as few files as you can to achieve your goal

## - If you do shadow, tell the theme developer, used to inform future development
