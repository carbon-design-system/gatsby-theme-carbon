# Carbon's website backstory

- Started as a standard React project
- Rebuilt using Gatsby and MDX
- Other teams wanted in
- Pre-theme pitfalls

<Notes>

## - Difficult for content authors and designers to contribute

## - Big win for empowering non-technical contributors

## - Only option was to fork Carbon

---

### Pitfalls

## - No way to get new features or fixes.

## - Developers stuck with config they don't own/understand

</Notes>

# Enter Gatsby themes

- Development speed
- Visual solidarity
- Shared features and fixes between teams
- Theme-managed configuration

<Notes>

- Broke ground April 15th,
  1. 2 teams with no Gatsby or react experience
  2. sold with just write markdown
  3. Both hit June 1st deadline
- unity through core UI components and global MDX
- community envolvement flourished due to shared tooling
  - in core theme components (edit in Github)
  - in MDX components (Accordion)
- only manage the dependancies & config you want (progressive disclosure)

## transition: big win for devs, shadowing another new big win

</Notes>

# What is shadowing?

<ul>
<li>Allows developers to augment or replace files in a theme</li>

<Appear>

<li>Shadowed files go in directory named after the theme
<ul>
<li className="list-p">

ex. `src/gatsby-theme-carbon/components/Footer.js`

</li>
<li>anything in this folder replaces the theme's version</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

The theme will reach for _your_ component first

</li>
<li>Shadowed components receive same props</li>

</Appear>

</ul>

# Content heavy slide

## Revelations building with themes

1. Immense power of shadowing

<Notes>

# In order

# Shadowing revelations

<img style={{ width: '60vw' }} src={Wow} />

<span style={{fontWeight: 300, fontSize: '0.6em', color: 'darkgrey', position: 'absolute', bottom: '-0.5em'}}>

**note:** the Carbon designers did not approve this slide

</span>

<Notes>

# At least the first one to get rid of filler content

</Notes>

# Shadow to provide props

```jsx
import Header from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/components/Header';

const CustomHeader = props => (
  <Header {...props}>
    <span>Gatsby theme </span>Carbon
  </Header>
);

export default CustomHeader;
```

<Notes>

# Don't forget to spread props

</Notes>

---

# Shadow whole components

```jsx
import { styles } from '@carbon/type';

const CustomHeader = styled.span({
  ...styles.expressiveHeading04,
});

export default props => {
  console.log(props);
  return <CustomHeader>Gatsby Theme Carbon</CustomHeader>;
};
```

<Notes>

# Log to view props

</Notes>

---

# Shadow _everything_

- Sass ‚Äì `src/components/Markdown.module.scss`
- Data ‚Äì `src/components/Code/prismTheme.js`
- Hooks - `src/util/hooks/useSearch.js`

---

# Shadowing guidelines

1. Communication
1. Less is more
1. Communication

<Notes>

## - to make sure no one is working on your change already

## - Shadow as few files as you can to achieve your goal

## - If you do shadow, tell the theme developer, used to inform future development

    <li>Themes align teams on form and function</li>
    <li>Shadow things. Not too much. Mostly to provide props.</li>

</ul>

<Notes>

- ## content authors and designers contribute like never before
