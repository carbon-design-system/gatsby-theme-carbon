## Outline

- Carbon website background
- Enter Gatsby themes
- AHA moments with Gatsby themes

---

## Carbon website backstory

- Started as a standard React project
- Rebuilt using Gatsby and MDX
- Other teams wanted in

<Notes>

- Difficult for content authors and designers to contribute
- Big win for empowering non-technical contributors
- Only option was to fork Carbon
  - No way to get new features or fixes.
  - Developers innundated with config they don't own or understand

</Notes>

---

## Enter Gatsby themes

- Development speed
- Visual solidarity through common UI
- Shared features and fixes between teams
- Managed dependancies and configuration

<Notes>

- Broke ground April 15th,
  - 2 teams with no Gatsby or react experience
  - Both hit June 1st deadline
- If you can write markdown, you can build a site with Carbon we fill in the blanks around your content
- Encouraged community envolvement
  - in core theme components (edit in Github)
  - in MDX components (Accordion)
- Easily move between projects, only manage the config you want (progressive disclosure)
