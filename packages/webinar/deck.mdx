# Carbon's website backstory

- Started as a standard React project
- Rebuilt using Gatsby and MDX
- Other teams wanted in

<Notes>

- Difficult for content authors and designers to contribute
- Big win for empowering non-technical contributors
- Only option was to fork Carbon
  - No way to get new features or fixes.
  - Developers innundated with config they don't own or understand

</Notes>

---

## Enter Gatsby themes

- Development speed
- Visual solidarity
- Shared features and fixes between teams
- Managed dependancies and configuration

<Notes>

- Broke ground April 15th,
  - 2 teams with no Gatsby or react experience
  - Both hit June 1st deadline
  - If you can write markdown, you can build a site with Carbon we fill in the blanks around your content
- unity through UI
- Encouraged community envolvement
  - in core theme components (edit in Github)
  - in MDX components (Accordion)
- Easily move between projects, only manage the config you want (progressive disclosure)

1. The immense power of shadowing

# Shadowing to provide props

```jsx
import Header from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/components/Header';

const CustomHeader = props => (
  <Header {...props}>
    <span>Gatsby theme </span>Carbon
  </Header>
);

export default CustomHeader;
```

---

# Shadow theme components

```jsx
import { styles } from '@carbon/type';

const CustomHeader = styled.span({
  ...styles.expressiveHeading04,
});

export default props => {
  console.log(props);
  return <CustomHeader>Gatsby Theme Carbon</CustomHeader>;
};
```

---

# Shadow **everything**

- Sass ‚Äì `src/components/Markdown.module.scss`
- Data ‚Äì `src/components/Code/prismTheme.js`
- Hooks - `src/util/hooks/useSearch.js`

# Caveats with shadowing

1. Communication

1. Less is more

1. Communication

<Notes>

- to make sure no one is working on your change already
- Shadow as few files as you can to achieve your goal
- If you do shadow, tell the theme developer, used to inform future development

</Notes>

# Takeaways

- Themes empower content authors
- Themes save devs a tremendous amount of time
- Themes allow teams to align on form and function
- Themes encourage community engagement and contribution
- Shadow things. Not too much. Mostly to provide props.

<Notes>

- content authors and designers contribute like never before
- also complexity overhead
