<PageDescription>

The `<Aside>` component is a wrapper component that adds styling to make the text display smaller than the default body text; using `body-long-01` and adds the correct top border styles. It should be used within a smaller `<Column>` width.

## Example

<Row>
<Column colMd={5} colLg={8} className="bx--type-expressive-heading-03">

It is more important than ever that we own our own ethos, make palpable our brand values, and incorporate an instantly identifiable IBMness in everything we do.

> Without aesthetic, design is either the humdrum repetition of familiar clichés or a wild scramble for novelty. Without aesthetic, the computer is but a mindless speed machine, producing effects without substance, form without relevant content, or content without meaningful form.
>
> <cite>– Paul Rand</cite>

Aesthetic is defined as the philosophical theory or set of principles governing outward appearance or actions.

</Column>
<Column colSm={0} colMd={2} colLg={3} noGutterSm>
<Aside>

**Good design is always good design.**

What we borrow from our own design history is not a mid-century aesthetic in stylistic terms, but the modernist attitudes and approach used at the time.
