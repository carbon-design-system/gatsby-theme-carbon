## Frontmatter

You can declare frontmatter in your `.mdx` files to provide specific metadata for the theme to use.
The most important of which is the `title`. You can also provide a description and keywords which will be added to the `head` of your document.

## Custom title

You can export a `Title` component in order to render a unique title for a single page. This is particularly useful for including line breaks at a specific location.

**Note:** You still need to provide a regular string title to the frontmatter for search, navigation, and the HTML header title to work.

```jsx

export const Title = () => (
  <span>
    First line <br /> Second line
  </span>
);
```
