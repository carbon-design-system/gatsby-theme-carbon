## Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables   |      Are      | Cool |
| -------- | :-----------: | ---: |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    1 |
| col 2 is |   centered    |    2 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |
