<PageDescription>

These are the built in components that you'll have access to simply by using markdown. The whitespace around these components **is significant**. If you encounter any errors, make sure you format the markdown and surounding space properly.

For most pages, we recommend starting with a `PageDescription` followed by `AnchorLinks` if the content is long enough.

</PageDescription>

<AnchorLinks>
  <AnchorLink>Text decoration</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Headers</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Lists</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Links</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Images</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Code blocks</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Tables</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Blockquotes</AnchorLink>
</AnchorLinks>

## Text decoration

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.
Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.
Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.
Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Headers

**Note:** It's generally considered [best practice](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/#contentstructure) to include just one `h1` heading per page. This heading signals the title or primary subject matter of the content to your audience. Because the title component generated at the top of each page already uses an `h1` heading, we recommend using `h2` tags for section headings within your content.

## H2

### H3

#### H4

##### H5

#### Code

```markdown src=https://github.com/carbon-design-system/gatsby-theme-carbon/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-carbon/src/components/markdown
## H2

### H3

#### H4

##### H5
```

## Lists

1. First ordered list item
2. Item with a nested item
   1. Nested list item
3. In markdown, the actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number

- Unordered list can use asterisks
  - Nested list item
- Or hyphens to create list items

## Links

[I'm a local link](/components/demo)

[I'm a markdown link](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com)

[I'm a markdown link with title](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com "Carbon's Homepage")

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

## Code blocks

You can read in depth about syntax highlighting and advanced code snippet features on the [Code blocks](/components/code-blocks) page.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```markdown Title
Blocks of code have three back-ticks above and below.

You can specify a language by placing it after the backticks.

You can also supply a source code URL or title to go at the top of the code block
```

#### Code

````markdown src=https://github.com/carbon-design-system/gatsby-theme-carbon/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-carbon/src/components/markdown
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```markdown Title
Blocks have three back-ticks above and below.
Pretend the backslashes aren't there.
```
````

You can view a list of included languages at the [react-prism-renderer repo](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/vendor/prism/includeLangs.js).

## Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables   |      Are      | Cool |
| -------- | :-----------: | ---: |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    1 |
| col 2 is |   centered    |    2 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

## Blockquotes and citations

It is more important than ever that we own our own ethos, make palpable our brand values, and incorporate an instantly identifiable IBMness in everything we do.

> This is a Blockquote.
> This line is part of the same quote.
