<PageDescription>

Using a Gatsby plugin, this component automatically builds three `ArticleCards` populated with the most recent Medium posts at build time.

</PageDescription>

<InlineNotification>

It is recommended that the preview images from Medium all follow a common aspect ratio, such as 16:9, in order to maintain similar height between the posts.

## Example

<MediumPosts color="dark" posts={3} />

## Code

```jsx path=components/MediumPosts/MediumPosts.js src=https://github.com/carbon-design-system/gatsby-theme-carbon/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-carbon/src/components/MediumPosts
<MediumPosts color="dark" posts={3} />
