<PageDescription>

The `<MotionSpec>` can be used to document how a component's motion / animation
behaves at a certain point or user interaction. It displays the individual
elements of a component and their transitions as a timeline.

## Example

<MotionSpec
  spec={[
    {
      element: 'Chevron',
      transitions: [
        {
          property: 'Rotation',
          curve: 'standard',
          mode: 'productive',
          duration: 120,
          delay: 30,
          from: '0째',
          to: '180째',
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      element: 'List',
      transitions: [
        {
          property: 'Opacity',
          curve: 'entrance',
          mode: 'productive',
          duration: 150,
          delay: 0,
          from: '0%',
          to: '100%',
        },
        {
          property: 'Height',
          curve: 'entrance',
          mode: 'productive',
          duration: 'moderate-01',
          delay: 0,
          from: '0',
          to: '16rem',
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
