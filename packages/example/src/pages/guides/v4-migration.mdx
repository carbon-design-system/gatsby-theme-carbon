title: V4.0 Migration
description: Guide for migrating to v4.0 of the theme
---

<PageDescription>

Version 4 of the Carbon Gatsby Theme uses version 5 of the Gatsby library.
Please read through the
[release](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.0/) notes in
the Gatsby documentation for more details.

The major version change comes with the potential for breaking changes, this
guide aims to cover the most likely issues a site built with the Carbon Gatsby
theme might encounter. To have the smoothest possible experience, we recommend
[upgrading to v3](/guides/v3-migration) of the Carbon Gatsby Theme first if you
haven't already done so.

</PageDescription>

## Breaking changes

1. You will need to convert your `gatsby-config.js` and `gatsby-node.js` to
   **.mjs** (node modules) files.

2. HTML-style comments will no longer work inside of mdx files, you will need to
   use JavaScript-style comments with curly braces:

```jsx
// Before
<!-- Place comments here -->
// After
{/* Place comments here */}
```

4. Homepage and default layouts have been moved from **templates** to **layout**
   components. Update any shadowing or links to template layouts.

```jsx
// Before
import Layout from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Default';
// After
import Layout from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/components/Layouts/Default';
```

5. If you are shadowing the homepage you need to update the file path
   `packages/example/src/components/Homepage.js`

```jsx
// Before
import HomepageTemplate from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Homepage';
// After
import HomepageTemplate from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/components/Layouts/Homepage';
```

## Gatsby migration guide

In this section we'll cover the most likely issues site's built with the Carbon
Gatsby theme might encounter when migrating. If you encounter any issues, or
your site leverages more advanced Gatsby configuration, check to see if it's
covered in the
[official Gatsby v5 migration guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v4-to-v5/).
To facilitate an easy upgrade path, we recommend
[upgrading to v3](/guides/v3-migration) of Carbon's Gatsby Theme first if you
haven't already done so.

<InlineNotification>

Note: We'll use yarn for the shell commands here. Replace them with the `npm`
equivalent if your project uses `npm` as its package manager.
