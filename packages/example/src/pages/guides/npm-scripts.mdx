<PageDescription>

Sites built with the Carbon Gatsby theme starter come ready to go with some
helpful npm scripts. You can run these commands by typing `yarn [command]` or
`npm run [command]`

## Clean

- **clean** - this is used to clean gatsby's cache and public directory. It
  should be used sparingly, only when you're experiencing weird errors or
  caching issues.

## Develop

- **dev** - this is your primary for starting up your gatsby site for
  development
- **dev:clean** - this is provided as a convenience; it first runs `clean`
  then `dev`

## Build

- **build** - this is what you'll use to bundle your site. Gatsby will minimize
  your images and create a static, blazing fast site in your `public` directory
- **serve** - this can be run to serve the bundle locally after running `build`.
  It can be used to debug locally if any issues are encountered durring build.
- **build:clean** - this is a provided as a convenience, it first runs `clean`
  then `build`
