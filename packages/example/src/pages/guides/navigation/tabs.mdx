<PageDescription>

You have the option of adding tabs to your pages. This is only recommended if
you have several pages that will use the same tabs. If you only have one page
with a set of tabs, it might be better for discoverability to change the tabs to
menu items.

## Tabs in YAML

To create a tabbed page, you just need to point the theme to the path of your
first tab. This is the structure of the YAML configuration for this page and
it’s siblings.

```yaml
- title: Guides
  pages:
    - title: Configuration
      path: /guides/configuration
    - title: Shadowing
      path: /guides/shadowing
    - title: Styling
      path: /guides/styling
    - title: Navigation
      path: /guides/navigation/sidebar
```

## File structure

Let’s check out the directory structure for this page. Notice how you’ll add
another directory that corresponds with the one in the YAML file.

    .
    ├── pages
    │   └── guides
    │       ├── configuration.mdx
    │       ├── shadowing.mdx
    │       ├── styling.mdx
    │       └── navigation
    │           ├── tabs.mdx
    │           └── sidebar.mdx

## Markdown updates

The last step is to add the name of your tabs to the front matter of each
markdown file that has tabs.

```markdown
---
title: Sidebar
tabs: ['Sidebar', 'Tabs']
---
```

### Tabs with apostrophes

If your tab name contains an apostrophe, you only need to include the
grammatically correct text in the frontmatter. Your file name and
`nav-items.yaml` should **not** include the apostrophe.

```markdown
---
title: Sidebar
tabs: ['Sidebar', 'What’s new']
---
```

For the _"What’s new"_ tab above, the source file would be `whats-new.mdx`, and
the path would look like `/guides/navigation/whats-new`.
