<PageDescription>

You have the option of adding tabs to your pages. This is only recommended if you have several pages that will use the same tabs. If you only have one page with a set of tabs, it might be better for discoverability to change the tabs to menu items.

## Tabs in YAML

To create a tabbed page, you just need to point the theme to the path of your first tab. This is the structure of the YAML configuration for this page and it’s siblings.

```yaml
- title: Guides
  pages:
    - title: Configuration
      path: /guides/configuration
    - title: Shadowing
      path: /guides/shadowing
    - title: Styling
      path: /guides/styling
    - title: Navigation
      path: /guides/navigation/sidebar
```

## File structure

Let’s check out the directory structure for this page. Notice how you’ll add another directory that corresponds with the one in the YAML file.

    .
    ├── pages
    │   └── guides
    │       ├── configuration.mdx
    │       ├── shadowing.mdx
    │       ├── styling.mdx
    │       └── navigation
    │           ├── tabs.mdx
    │           └── sidebar.mdx

## Markdown updates

The last step is to add the name of your tabs to the front matter of each markdown file that has tabs.

**Known issue**: at the moment, your tab name needs to match your title for the navigation components to function properly.

```markdown
---
title: Sidebar
tabs: ['Sidebar', 'Tabs']
---
```
