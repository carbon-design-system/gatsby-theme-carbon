<PageDescription>

You have the option of adding tabs to your pages. This is really only recommended if you have many pages with the same tabs. If you just have one page a set of tabs, it might be better for discoverability to make those menu items.

## Tabs in YAML

To create a tabbed page, you just need to point the theme to the path of your first tab. This is the structure of the YAML configuration for this page and it's siblings.

```yaml
- title: Guides
  pages:
    - title: Configuration
      path: /guides/configuration
    - title: Shadowing
      path: /guides/shadowing
    - title: Styling
      path: /guides/styling
    - title: Navigation
      path: /guides/navigation/sidebar
```

## File structure

Lets check out the directory structure for this page. Notice how you'll add another directory that corresponds with the one in the YAML file.

    .
    ├── pages
    │   └── guides
    │       ├── configuration.mdx
    │       ├── shadowing.mdx
    │       ├── styling.mdx
    │       └── navigation
    │           ├── tabs.mdx
    │           └── sidebar.mdx

## Markdown updates

The last step is to add the name of your tabs to the front matter of each markdown file that has tabs.

**Known issue**: at the moment, your tab name needs to match your title for the navigation components to function properly.

```markdown
---
title: Sidebar
tabs: ['Sidebar', 'Tabs']
---
```
