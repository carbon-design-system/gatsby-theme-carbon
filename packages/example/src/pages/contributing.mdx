## Project setup

1. Go to [gatsby-theme-carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/gatsby-theme-carbon) and click the `Fork` button in the top-right corner.

1. After it's finished, click on the `Clone or Download` button and copy the contents.

1. In your terminal, clone the repo into your directory of choice

   ```sh
   git clone [PASTE_URL_HERE]
   cd gatsby-theme-carbon
   ```

1. When you clone your forked repo the `origin` is set to your fork by default. You'll want to add a remote that points to the upstream repo.

   ```sh
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:carbon-design-system/gatsby-theme-carbon.git
   ```

1. In your terminal, verify that the remotes have been set

   ```sh
   git remote -v
   ```

## Development

We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) and yarn workspaces to develop the Carbon Gatsby theme. This allows us to have a development environment that's closely linked to the theme with minimal setup. Run `yarn install` to install all of the projects dependencies.

This project has two packages: the actual theme package (`gatsby-theme-carbon`) and the `example` package. The example package emulates a project which uses the theme. Its only dependencies are Gatsby, React, and the adjacent theme package. The `example` package also serves as the theme's documentation and [website](https://gatsby-theme-carbon.now.sh); it's deployed on every merge to master.

New theme development will happen in the theme package while documentation and testing of that change will occur through changes in the example directory.

### Development scripts

- `yarn dev` – start the development environment
- `yarn dev:clean` – clear cache and restart dev
- `yarn format` – format your code with prettier
- `yarn lint` - check for errors in your javascript

## Work in a branch

You should always start a new project by pulling upstream changes into master and then creating a new branch. This workflow ensures you don't accidentally commit anything to your master branch and get stuck when trying to open a pull request.

```sh
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b my-branch-name
```

When you're ready to open a pull request, push to your origin remote.

```sh
git push origin my-branch-name
```

You'll get a message in your terminal with a URL to open up a pull request in the upstream repository. Navigate to that URL and be sure to give a detailed summary of your pull request in the title and body section of the form.

## Sass and CSS Modules

For internal theme components we use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) and [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules#css-modules). This allows us to take advantage of the Carbon Design System resources while not worrying about className collisions. By default, each `.scss` file will be supplied with all of the Carbon Sass [variables](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/packages/components/src/globals/scss/_vars.scss): color, spacing, theme, and motion, as well as type and layout mixins, are imported automatically.

You should colocate your stylesheet with the component(s) that import it. If the component is `TreeView` then the stylesheet should be `TreeView.module.scss`. All contained within the `TreeView` directory.

### CSS Modules

You don't need to prefix your classes as CSS Modules will generate unique class names for you. Import the class from the `.scss` file.

```scss path=TreeView.module.scss
.treeView {
  color: $text-01;
}
```

```jsx path=TreeView.js
import { treeView } from './style.css';

const TreeView = props => <div className={treeView} />;
```

For conditionally applying class names, use the `classname` library. Note how we're using a [computed property name](https://tylermcginnis.com/computed-property-names/) for the property being based to `cx`. That's because the className isn't literally `"long"` it's a value generated by CSS Modules and placed in the `long` variable.

```jsx path=TreeView.js
import cx from 'classname';
import { treeView, long } from './style.css';

const TreeView = props => {
  const className = cx(treeView, {
    [long]: props.long,
  });
  const TreeView = props => <div className={className} />;
};
```

If you need to target a global class not processed by CSS Modules, you can do so with the [global selector](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules#exceptions).

```scss
:global(.bx--grid) .codeBlock {
  @include carbon--type-style('code-01');
}
```

## VS Code

To get linting error feedback while writing javascript and SCSS in VS Code, install the [stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shinnn.stylelint) and [ESlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extensions. We use ESLint's Prettier rules to format and lint all of our JavaScript in one pass. To get your code to format properly on save, add the following to a `.vscode/settings.json` in the root of your project

```json path=.vscode/settings.json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "[javascript]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": false
  },
  "[javascriptreact]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": false
  },
  "eslint.autoFixOnSave": true,
  "prettier.disableLanguages": ["javascript", "javascriptreact"]
}
```

To lint the entire project and get errors in your `Problems` tray, you can add the following to a `.vscode/tasks.json` file in the root of your project. You can run these tasks with `cmd+shift+d`

```json path=.vscode/tasks.json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "npm",
      "script": "lint:js",
      "problemMatcher": "$eslint-stylish"
    },
    {
      "type": "npm",
      "script": "lint:scss",
      "problemMatcher": {
        "owner": "stylelint",
        "fileLocation": ["relative", "${workspaceFolder}"],
        "pattern": [
          {
            "regexp": "^([^\\s].*)$",
            "file": 1
          },
          {
            "regexp": "^\\s+(\\d+):(\\d+)\\s+(✖|warning)\\s+(.*)\\s\\s+(.*)$",
            "line": 1,
            "column": 2,
            "severity": 3,
            "message": 4,
            "code": 5,
            "loop": true
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
