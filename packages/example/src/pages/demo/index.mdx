Add-on repositories, or repos, are components built for a specific product or
experience. The repos are built on top of the core Carbon repo, and enable
teams to create their own custom components that follow Carbon's visual style
and guidelines.

IBMers believe in progress—that application of intelligence, reason and science can improve business, society and the human condition.

Given our scale and scope, ‘good design’ is not only a requirement, it’s a deeper responsibility to relationships we seek to serve.

## Building **bonds**

Today, the talent, techniques, thinking and tools of design, like technology, have become more and more abundant and accessible to all alike.

Paradoxically, decisions are more distributed, and experiences can become less and less distinctive. The rapid, relentless pace to produce can create an uneven emphasis on immediacy and incrementalism over individuality and innovation.

It is more important than ever that we own our own ethos, make palpable our brand values, and incorporate an instantly identifiable IBMness in everything we do.

> Without aesthetic, design is either the humdrum repetition of familiar clichés or a wild scramble for novelty. Without aesthetic, the computer is but a mindless speed machine, producing effects without substance, form without relevant content, or content without meaningful form.
> – Paul Rand

Aesthetic is defined as the philosophical theory or set of principles governing outward appearance or actions. This characteristic applied to any experience is essential to its effectiveness. Everything we do (and don’t do) communicates. The care and craft we put into every experience is equal to any confidence or consideration we should expect in return.

<Aside>

**Good design is always good design.**

What we borrow from our own design history is not a mid-century aesthetic in stylistic terms, but the modernist attitudes and approach used at the time.

Eliot Noyes taught us brand is character, and should be built through curation. Paul Rand taught us the importance of endless experimentation. Charles and Ray Eames brought out our playful nature, and were pioneering what is now referred to as “branded content” and “experiential.”

Their methods are as modern today as ever before, maybe more so.

## Checklist

Please answer yes or no to the following list of questions:

- Is your team using Carbon components?
- Does your team have the need to add custom components in addition to Carbon's core components?
- Will these components only be needed by your team?
- Do you need these custom components to match Carbon's visual style?

## Contributing to add-ons

Add-ons are generally easier to contribute to because they are not fully managed by the Carbon team. Below are the items that you need to pass in order for your contribution to be accepted. You can read our full contribution process for [design](/contributing/designers) and [development](/contributing/developers) to learn more.
